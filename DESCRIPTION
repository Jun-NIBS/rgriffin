Description:
    The rgriffin package is an R connector to griffin (http://turing.iimas.unam.mx/griffin/). Gene Regulatory Interaction Formulator For Inquiring Networks (griffin) is a java library for inference and analysis of Boolean Network models. Griffin takes as inputs biologically meaningful constraints and turns them into a symbolic representation. Using a SAT engine, griffin explores the Boolean Network search space, finding all satisfying assignments that are compatible with the specified constraints.
    The rgriffin package includes a number of functions to interact with the BoolNet package.
    See the Jupyter Tutorials for more examples.
